# Simple memory leak checker for 42 students

This repo contains some simple but very helpful tools for debugging your code.

## Current debug functions

`check_leaks()`
> NOW NORMINETTE SAFE!

## How to use:

1. Run `make` to create a library of the debug functions
2. Now you can link the library in your Makefile
3. And you can add `check_leaks();` to the end of your main

## Example output when a memory leak is caught:

![Example output when there is a memory leak](Example_output.png "Example output in case of memory leaks")
> Here there is a clear memory leak that starts in the "get_commands" function (either memory that doesn't get free'd at the end or something else ...)
## Some helpful links to practice the fine art of RTFM

1. Ever wondered what the difference is between SEGFAULT and BUS error?

2. A descriptive wiki about memory management:

### Halp I still don't know how to debug my code!

`man RTFM`
